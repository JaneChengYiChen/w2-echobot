- Library I Use [GoDotEnv](https://github.com/joho/godotenv)

### Have learned
- Using linebot sdk of go
- Parsing configuration with library GoDotEnv

### Difficulties
```
(1)
When I was trying to build an echo bot, I did not understand how to parse env config. 
THere are many types of env I can choose, like json, yaml, ini...etc.
I took .env to be my choice because its clear and simple feature.  

(2)
Totally having no idea to use sdk, so I did took some time to see others' code.
Many thanks especially from the very beginner like me to learn how to use this programming language.
